This code creates a cloropleth map of the United States with shading based on the Gross Inflow of Earnings the state had in 2021. The data used for this map is from the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis, an agency of the Department of Commerce. The color scale is set on a scale of 0 to 120 million, and the shading of the state will indicate it's amount of earnings. 

The user will need to install plotly. To install this, please type into terminal "conda install plotly". If the user does not already have pandas installed, the user should do so by typing into the terminal "conda install pandas".
